When setting up a new alt.chi reviewing system, you have to update some variables.

In System.php:

Line 22: $submissionsPath
Line 24: $submissionsUrl
Line 134: $mail->From
Line 135: $mail->FromName
Line 169: $mail->From
Line 170: $mail->FromName
Line 180: $mail->Body

For author information, will need to alter smarty template author_dump.tpl

Downformaintenance.tpl
Line 9: contact information

English_review.tpl
Line 11: contact information

Index.tpl
Line 6: title

Introduction.tpl might need some editing. This is what users see when they’re not logged in.

Portal.tpl will the the file that needs editing the most – that is where you let people know if the system is open for submission, reviewin, etc. or if it’s closed. This is what users see when they are logged in.

In show_submission.tpl will need to adjust lines 31-36 for new author names format.

In show_submission_guest.tpl will need to do this on lines 19-22

Start.tpl looks like it’s obsolete.

Submission_confirm.tpl and submission_confirm2.tpl will need editing lines 21-29 for new author names. Check also lines 77-83… not sure what’s going on with “extra names”.

Submission.tpl might have to change lines 41-48 for new author names.

Submisson2.tpl same, 39-41

Update_submission.tpl lines 17-20 for new author names.

Verified.tpl – line 6, update to 2013

Verify_conditions.tpl line 24 – update to 2013

Verify_notagree.tpl line 16 – update organizer names

Changing the status of reviewing (not open yet, open, no longer open) happens in show_submission lines 215-260

Email information in login.php lines 57-70

In db.php you’ll need to set:

$dbuser
$dbpass
$dbname
and any other variables that are specific to your database setup.
