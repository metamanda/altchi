<h1>The alt.chi 2013 Jury</h1>
<p>Alt.chi aims to attract unusual, interesting, thought-provoking work to be presented at CHI. We realize that sometimes the conventional reviewing process can fail to pick up on truly innovative work that does not fit the mold of the typical CHI paper. </p>
<p>The alt.chi 2013 selection process allows for a period of open review and debate. We think that open review is accountable and inclusive, and it's great for gauging a paper's capacity to stimulate interest and discussion. But it can also be subject to the law of averages by relying on the "wisdom of the crowd".</p>
<p>Truly ground breaking work can be unjudgable by familiar standards. So we found some smart, skeptical-but-optimistic, insightful jurors who can allow their decisions to be informed by the open reviewing process. Instead of looking for flaws, imperfections, and reasons to reject a submission, they look for sparks of interest, originality, insight, and good reasons to accept a submission.</p>
<p>Here's our jury for 2013:</p>
<p><b><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~ast/">Alex Taylor</a></b> is a member of the Socio- Digital Systems Group at Microsoft Research Cambridge. He has undertaken investigations into a range of routine and often mundane aspects of everyday life, to the point of distraction. His studies of home life, for instance, have given rise to an unhealthy preoccupation with hoarding, dirt, clutter and other similar seemingly banal things. More recently, he's been captivated by the innovations in artificial intelligence and computational biology and pondered on what the unceasing developments in both areas might mean for what we know and how we know it.</p>
<!--p><b><a href="http://www.gold.ac.uk/interaction">Bill Gaver</a></b> is Professor of Design and leads the Interaction Research Studio at Goldsmiths, University of London. With his group, he has developed approaches to design ranging from Cultural Probes to the use of documentary film to help assess peoples' experience with designs, pursued conceptual work on topics such as ambiguity and interpretation, and produced highly-finished prototypes that have been deployed for long-term field trials and exhibited in major international exhibitions. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of the Arts and a member of the SIGCHI Academy. Current projects concern designing computational devices for older people, batch production of research prototypes for large-scale field trials, and co-designing communities and devices to explore energy use.</p>
<p>Dr <b><a href="http://www.urbaninformatics.net/people/christine/">Christine Satchell</a></b> is a Senior Research Fellow with the Urban Informatics Research Lab at Queensland University of Technology and an Honorary Research Fellow with the Interaction Design Group at The University of Melbourne. Her research is dedicated to understanding the social and cultural nuances of everyday user behavior in order to inform the design of new technology. Integral to this is the development of a methodological approach that embeds cultural theory within HCI. This led to the development of The Swarm, a patented mobile phone prototype that supports nuanced social interactions through the formation of multiple, simultaneous digital identities. She has published numerous peer reviewed book chapters, journals articles and conference papers, and co-edited the book From Social Butterfly to Urban Citizen: The Evolution of the Mobile Phone User which had just been released by MIT Press. The current focus of her work is on HCI After Dark.</p-->
<p><b><a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bjoern/">Bjoern Hartmann</a></b> is an Assistant Professor in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley. He received a BA in Communication, a BSE in Digital Media Design, and an MSE in Computer and Information Science from the University of Pennsylvania in 2002. He received his PhD degree in Computer Science from Stanford University in 2009. His research in Human-Computer Interaction focuses on novel design, prototyping, and implementation tools for the era of post-personal computing. As our interaction with computation increasingly moves away from single-user desktop applications, he investigates two particular frontiers: tool support for user interfaces that leverage novel form factors (e.g., sensors and actuators); and interfaces that rely on crowds of users for their core functionality. His research also helps end-user groups become more proficient in complex user interface tools and programming systems. He is co-director of two research units: the Berkeley Institute of Design and the Swarm Lab, and co-initiated the CITRIS Invention Lab, a new digital fabrication and rapid prototyping space.</p>
