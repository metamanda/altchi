<h1>About alt.chi English Review</h1>

<p>We want to thank the student volunteers who made it possible for us to provide this service. Author feedback regarding the speed and quality of their work was overwhelmingly positive. These folks all deserve kudos:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adam Van Sertima, Concordia University</li>
<li>Dennis Ellis, Indiana University</li>
<li>Gene Dreyband, Indiana University</li>
<li>Stephanie Poppe, Indiana University</li>
</ul>
<p>Special thanks to Gopinaath Kannabiran from Indiana University for helping us recruit reviewers.</p>
<p>Alt.chi aims to attract unusual, interesting, thought-provoking work to be presented at CHI. Though we always select high-quality content, we encourage diversity in thinking, methodology, and application area -- we want to attract presenters that you might not otherwise encounter at CHI!</p>

<p>We're all about removing barriers to the presentation of great work, and one of those barriers involves language. We want to ensure that submissions to alt.chi are judged on the merits of the ideas, not the grammar of the writing.</p>

<p>If you want to take advantage of our English review service, here's what you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to request English review, email your paper draft to <a href="mailto:altchi@chi2013.acm.org?subject=[alt.chi english review]">altchi@chi2013.acm.org</a>. The subject line should include the phrase "[alt.chi english review]" -- if it doesn't include this, we don't guarantee a quick response.</li>
<li>The alt.chi submission deadline is January 9. We ask authors who want to use our English review service to send drafts <b>before December 31</b>. We will ask that English reviewers return reviewed drafts by January 4 in order to give the authors enough time to revise.</li>
<li>English reviewers are providing an editorial service focused on grammar and clarity -- they are not providing feedback on the content of the submission (that happens later, during the discussion period).</li>
<li>Requests will be treated on a first-come, first-served basis. The sooner you send your request for English review, the sooner your work will be reviewed.</li>
<li>After receiving an English review from our volunteers, it is up to you to alter your submission according to your reviewer's suggestions.</li>
<li>The English review service does not directly affect your submission's acceptance or rejection.</li>
<li>Our English reviewers are volunteers; please be patient.</li>
<li>The English review service does not alter the submission process. You must complete your submission before the deadline, even if you have not received any feedback from the English Review Service team.</li>
</ul>

<p>We hope you find this service to be genuinely helpful. This is a pilot program, and we can't guarantee that we'll be able to continue this service indefinitely. Your feedback will help us decide how to handle this going forward. Please let us know if this service has helped you, or if we can do anything to improve it.</p>
