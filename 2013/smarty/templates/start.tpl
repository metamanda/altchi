<em><a href="index.php?action=showsubmission&id=47">The Evolution of Evaluation (20+10)</a></em><br />
Joseph “Jofish” Kaye, Cornell University, USA<br />
Phoebe Sengers, Cornell University, USA<br />
We provide a historical context for assessing evaluation methods by explicating the history of evaluation in HCI. We trace the history of evaluation in the field from electrical engineering and computer science, to experimental approaches drawn from cognitive science, to usability’s emphasis on in-situ studies and expertise.

<em><a href="index.php?action=showsubmission&id=78">From Mice to Men – 24 years of Evaluation in CHI (15+5)</a></em><br />
Louise Barkhuus, University of Glasgow, UK<br />
Jennifer A. Rode, Donald Bren School of Information, USA<br />
This paper analyzes trends in the approach to evaluation taken by CHI papers in the last 24 years. A set of papers was analyzed according to our schema for classifying type of evaluation. Our analysis traces papers’ trend in type and scope of evaluation. Findings include an increase in the proportion of papers that include evaluation, and a decrease in the median number of subjects in quantitative studies.

<em><a href="index.php?action=showsubmission&id=71">Make Evaluation Poverty History (15+5)</a></em><br />
Gilbert Cockton, University of Sunderland, UK<br />
Argues for the need to ground evaluation in achieved worth rather than established psychological measures, and proposes the use of worth maps, based on approaches from consumer psychology, to do so, providing a shared representation for design and evaluation.

<em><a href="index.php?action=showsubmission&id=49">The Three Paradigms of HCI (20+10)</a></em><br />
Steve Harrison, Virginia Tech, USA<br />
Deborah Tatar, Virginia Tech, USA <br />
Phoebe Sengers, Cornell University, USA <br />
Informal histories of HCI commonly document two major intellectual waves that have formed the field: the first orienting from engineering/human factors with its focus on optimizing man-machine fit, and the second stemming from cognitive science, with an increased emphasis on theory and on what is happening not only in the computer but, simultaneously, in the human mind. In this paper, we document underlying forces that constitute a third wave in HCI and suggest systemic consequences for the CHI community.

<em><a href="index.php?action=showsubmission&id=72">Questioning the Technological Panacea: Three Reflective Questions for Designers (15+5)</a></em><br />
Eric Baumer, University of California, Irvine, USA<br />
Bill Tomlinson, University of California, Irvine, USA<br />
This paper argues that asking whether or not a technological solution is appropriate should be an explicit and exposed part of the design process. It raises three questions that should be addressed during the design process: Are there other, possibly non-technological, solutions that could address the problem equally well, if not better? Are designers creating solutions to problems that users themselves do not need to have? Are these technological solutions treating a problem rather than its cause?

<em><a href="index.php?action=showsubmission&id=74">Uptake of Situationism Considered Harmful (15+5)</a></em><br />
Lucian Leahu, Cornell University, USA<br />
Claudia Pederson , Cornell University, USA<br />
Jennifer Thom-Santelli, Cornell University, USA<br />
Pavel Dmitriev, Cornell University, USA<br />
Phoebe Sengers, Cornell University, USA<br />
We examine Situationist art practice as an inspiration for HCI design. We argue that methods from Situationist art practice have often been picked up without regard for their underlying sensibility. We describe an experiment in incorporating Situationist sensibility in design and use it to elucidate the challenges that face HCI in truly integrating the arts.

<em><a href="index.php?action=showsubmission&id=36">Computer Imagination as Holographic Processor for Text Animation (15+5)</a></em><br />
Adim Astakhov, University of California San Diego, USA<br />
Tamara Astakhova, University of California San Diego, USA<br />
Brian Sanders, University of California San Diego, USA<br />
Imagination is the critical point in developing of realistic artificial intelligence (AI) systems. One way to approach imagination would be simulation of its properties and operations. We developed two models “Brain Network Hierarchy of Languages”, “Semantical Holographic Calculus” and simulation system ScriptWriter that emulate the process of imagination through an automatic animation of English texts.

<em><a href="index.php?action=showsubmission&id=60">Challenges in human-computer interaction for manned Mars exploration (20+10)</a></em><br />
Kim Binsted, University of Hawaii, USA<br />
A seven-member crew (including the author) will spend four full months (May-Aug 2007) at the Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station (FMARS) in Haughton Crater on Devon Island in the Canadian Arctic, in a Mars manned exploration simulation. The simulation will be as realistic as possible: limited water, cramped quarters, going outside in EVA (extra-vehicular activity) suits only, preserved food etc. The author will present remotely from the FMARS habitat, giving a tour of the facility and its equipment, and discussing various human-computer interaction issues.

<em><a href="index.php?action=showsubmission&id=38">Augmented Nature: Activated, Actuated and Animated Small Natures with Pervasive Computers (15+5)</a></em><br />
Hiroya Tanaka, Keio-University, Japan. <br />
Yusuke Murata, Keio-University, Japan<br />
This paper proposes our novel way to design new-style "nature-mediated" interactive gadgets. It can also be called “computer-embedded small natures”. We adopted small, natural and inorganic earth materials such as rough stones (on the street) and raw shells (on the beach), and embedded small micro-controllers into them for giving interactive functions.

<em><a href="index.php?action=showsubmission&id=42">Full-Context Videos for First-Time, Non-Literate PC Users (15+5)</a></em><br />
Indrani Medhi, Microsoft Research Labs India Pvt, India<br />
Kentaro Toyama, Microsoft Research Labs India Pvt, India<br />
Following previous work focused on non-literate users, we observed that in spite of our subjects’ understanding of the UI mechanics, they experienced barriers beyond illiteracy in interacting with the computer: lack of awareness of what the PC could deliver, fear and mistrust of the technology, and lack of comprehension about how information relevant to them was embedded in the PC. In this paper, we address these challenges with full-context video, which includes dramatizations of how a user might use the application and how relevant information comes to be contained in the computer, in addition to a tutorial of the UI.

<em><a href="index.php?action=showsubmission&id=41">Power of the Few vs. Wisdom of the Crowd: Wikipedia and the Rise of the Bourgeoisie (15+5)</a></em><br />
Aniket Kittur, University of California, Los Angeles, USA<br />
Ed Chi, Palo Alto Research Center Inc., USA<br />
Bryan A. Pendleton, Palo Alto Research Center Inc., USA<br />
Bongwon Suh, Palo Alto Research Center Inc., USA<br />
Todd Mytkowicz, University of Colorado at Boulder, USA<br />
In this study we examined how the influence of “elite” vs. “common” users changed over time in Wikipedia. The results suggest that although Wikipedia was driven by the influence of “elite” users early on, more recently there has been a dramatic shift in workload to the ”common” user. We also show the same shift in del.icio.us, a very different type of social collaborative knowledge system.

<em><a href="index.php?action=showsubmission&id=55">Table Tennis for Three - the Video (10+2)</a></em><br />
Florian 'Floyd' Mueller, The University of Melbourne, Australia	<br />
Martin Gibbs, The University of Melbourne, Australia<br />
We aim to demonstrate that a networked exerting leisure game for three players is possible and can be enjoyed by players. We believe it can be inspiring for other CHI researchers who design interfaces that aim to support social interactions between geographically distant participants.

<em><a href="index.php?action=showsubmission&id=64">Design of an Ecosystem for Ad-Hoc End-User Prototyping (10+2)</a></em><br />
Seung Chan Lim, MAYA Design, USA<br />
Peter Lucas, MAYA Design, USA<br />
Our goal with the Javascript Dataflow Architecture (JDA) is to bring this spirit of end-user innovation back to the Web. We aim to achieve this while fully harnessing the powerful modern day Web technologies. The architecture fosters the growth of a marketplace of components and lends itself nicely to the ad-hoc copy-paste-and-tweak paradigm of end-user rapid prototyping.

<em><a href="index.php?action=showsubmission&id=73">Arduino: An Open Electronics Prototyping Platform (10+2)</a></em><br />
David Mellis, Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design, Denmark<br />
Massimo Banzi, Tinker.it!, Italy<br />
David Cuartielles, Malmö University, Sweden<br />
Tom Igoe, ITP, Tisch School of the Arts, NYU, USA<br />
Arduino is a platform for prototyping interactive objects using electronics. It consists of both hardware and software: a circuit board that can be purchased at low cost or assembled from freely-available plans; and an open-source development environment and library for writing code to control the board. Arduino comes from a philosophy of learning by doing and strives to make it easy to work directly with the medium of interactivity.

<em><a href="index.php?action=showsubmission&id=61">Tug n’ Talk: A Belt Buckle for Tangible Tugging Communication (10+2)</a></em><br />
Drew Harry, MIT Media Lab, USA<br />
Matt Adcock, MIT Media Lab, USA<br />
Matthew Boch, Harvard University, USA<br />
Vanessa Harden, MIT Media Lab, USA<br />
Raul-David V. Poblano, MIT Media Lab, USA<br />
Tug n’ Talk is a prototype of a tuggable communication device, allowing for intimate communication between two individuals using tugging as a metaphor. In this paper we discuss the advantages of tugging over other haptic communication modalities, such as vibration, with a focus on input/output spaces and meaning construction.

<em><a href="index.php?action=showsubmission&id=54">Qualities of Perceived Aesthetic in Data Visualization (10+2)</a></em><br />
Nick Cawthon, University of Sydney, Australia<br />
Andrew Vande Moere, University of Sydney, Australia<br />
Through results gathered from a large-scale online survey, this paper empirically investigates the assessment of aesthetic in 11 common data visualization techniques. Visualizations represented in this study were generated from an identical hierarchical dataset and visually normalized to avoid unwanted implications of default application parameters or personal preferences.
