<h1>Verification</h1>

<h2>Conditions</h2>

<p>
To take part in the alt.chi review process (including submitting and reviewing contributions, and posting in on-line discussions) you must agree to the following conditions.
</p>

<p>
<b>No cheating</b>:
<br>
I agree to not attempt to maliciously influence the reviewing and selection process, e.g. by submitting reviews under false names, coercing others into writing biased reviews, etc.
</p>

<p>
<b>Full disclosure</b>:
<br>
As reviewer, I agree to provide full information on my relationship to the authors of each submission I review, as well as any other information that may influence my objectivity.
<br>
As submitter, I agree to provide full information on all factors that could affect the fair judgment of my submission's suitability for presentation at CHI 2007, e.g. if all or part of it has been previously published, if it is currrently under review at CHI or any other conference or journal, etc.
</p>

<p>
<b>Be nice</b>:
<br>
I agree to keep the alt.chi forum a welcoming and civil place for open-minded discussions. This includes not using offensive language, refraining from personal attacks, and keeping discussions reasonably on topic.
</p>

<p>
Anyone who is found to break this agreement will have all their submissions, reviews and forum posts immediately removed from the site.
</p>
