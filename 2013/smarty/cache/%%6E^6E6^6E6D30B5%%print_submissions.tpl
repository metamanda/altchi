<div class="textbox">Most mobile systems are ëstop-to-interactí; designed for active interaction only when a user is standing still, paying visual and mental attention to the device. However, people are increasingly carrying and using devices while undertaking a wide range of movement activities, such as walking, cycling, running. Some existing systems such as Appleís Siri aim for hands and eyes free use, but they do not consider the wider challenges of interaction during movement.<br />
<br />
We describe the challenges of system design for active mobile interaction. These ëinteraction in motioní challenges are discussed with reference to an extreme movement interaction situation ñ cold water swimming.<br />

<div class="textbox">We introduce EmoSnaps, a mobile application that captures pictures of oneís facial expressions throughout the day and uses them for later recall of her momentary emotions. We describe a field study that employs EmoSnaps in an attempt to investigate if and how individuals infer emotions from self-face pictures. Recalled emotions through EmoSnaps are compared to ground truth data as derived from Experience Sampling. Contrary to our expectations, it was shown that by increasing the temporal distance of recall to an experience and by reducing temporal context, we increase usersí ability to infer their emotions from a self-face picture.</div>

<div class="textbox">One of the primary goals of Affective Computing (AC) is to develop computer interfaces that automatically detect and respond to usersí emotions. Despite significant progress, ìbasic emotionsî (e.g., anger, disgust, sadness) have been emphasized in AC at the expense of other non-basic emotions. The present paper questions this emphasis by analyzing data from five studies that systematically tracked both basic and non-basic emotions. The results indicate that engagement, boredom, confusion, and frustration (all non-basic emotions) occurred at five times the rate of basic emotions after generalizing across tasks, interfaces, and methodologies. Implications of these findings for AC are discussed</div>

<div class="textbox">While things (i.e., technologies) play a crucial role in creating and shaping meaningful, positive experiences, their true value lies only in the resulting experiences. It is about what we can do and experience with a thing, about the stories unfolding through using a technology, not about its styling, material, or impressive list of fea-tures. This paper explores the notion of \"experiences\" further: from the link between experiences and well-being and society and people\&#039;s developing post-materialistic stance to the challenges of the experience market and the experience-driven design of technology.</div>

<div class="textbox">While most traditional user interfaces are designed to pursue convenience by eliminating user operations and by automating tasks, some new categories of HCI, such as health support, may require explicit human participation and effort to achieve long-term benefits.  For these areas, interfaces that require interactions that force users to perform activities, rather than interfaces that solely perform tasks on behalf of users, are becoming increasingly important.  We refer to these new interactions as Åginconvenient interactionsÅh.  In this note we discuss why carefully designed inconveniences can enrich our lives, and provide some preliminary but concrete examples.  We also explain our initial guidelines for the design of these interactions.</div>

We analyze the history of relevant disciplines and discuss the findings of an online survey completed by academics and professionals, which indicates a high variety in interpretation of terms. Further, we discuss surveys of job descriptions and related academic programs, and provide our perspective on the impact of this problem, as well as suggestions on how to begin to solve it.</div>

<div class="textbox">With the widespread use of smartphones, users tend to use their smartphones for a long period of time with unhealthy postures, bending forward their upper body including the neck. If users keep such an unhealthy posture for a long time, their neck and back muscles get chronically strained, which might cause diseases such as cervical myalgia. To prevent these diseases, we propose a new methodology to monitor the posture of smartphone users with built-in sensors. The proposed mechanism estimates a value representing user postures like head/neck tilt angle by analyzing sensor data from a front-faced camera, 3-axis accelerometer, and orientation sensor. It then informs the user if the estimated value is maintained within the abnormal range over a pre-defined time.</div>

<div class="textbox">Many mobile devices use touchscreens for text entry. They also provide vibration and audio feedback to simulate interaction with a physical keyboard. To facilitate design decisions of new mobile text entry methods, we conducted a survey and a user study to measure userís feedback preference and the effect of feedback modes on typing performance. We found that the majority of respondents prefer no aural or haptic feedback. In our study, feedback mode had no statistically significant effect on entry speed or accuracy. However, comments made by users suggest that feedback preference is due to situational factors, rather than performance considerations.</div>

<div class="textbox">I examine current debates concerning digital badges in education, pointing to less remarked upon topics. By investigating badges as motivators, I conclude that a focus on badges as rewards has downplayed the importance of badge conditionalities (&#039;tails&#039;) and entitlements (&#039;antennae&#039;), and their always situated effectiveness. Current discussions of badges as evidence-based credentials understate the interpretive work required to make sense of badge collections. I propose two heuristic definitions of badges as &#039;routes through an activity system&#039; and as &#039;genres of hint-based multi-authored testimony of learning&#039;. Alternative definitions are invited, as tools-for-thought.</div>

that a shift in terminology, replacing ìuserî with ìhumanî or ìpersonî, will positively affect not just our use of jargon, but our fundamental concerns with design. Through a study of the word itself, including its historical usage in the English language, and then its usage in the corpus of CHI scholarship, we will show that a consideration of these factors could drastically change how we envision and interpret the work of our own community and positively affect the design process.</div>

<div class="textbox">Movement researchers in HCI often utilize theories from the field of Somatics to support their investigations into tangible, ubiquitous, and wearable computing systems. Despite recent advances in integrating movement theory within HCI, the practice of incorporating the associated Somatic methods and referencing the epistemological perspective integral to their development is often lacking. This epistemological gap limits both the value of the theories and their potential to inform HCI interaction models. In this paper we discuss the value of Somatic epistemology and provide a case study to illustrate the benefits of bridging Somatic theories and their associated methods.</div>

Increasing the range of physical movement to full body can allow patients to reveal information about their mental and psychological state, which helps achieve therapeutic goals. With corroboration from research findings, validated data were collected from art therapy practitioners and further analyzed. The results indicate a tool of this type can aid therapistsí achieving goals by facilitating clients to express emotions and creatively, including clients prone to impaired verbal communication and people with physical disabilities or emotional problems.</div>

<div class="textbox">This paper categorises key HCI literature that engages with performance theory or practice according to a taxonomy that puts the user at the centre of the analysis. This taxonomy has revealed three strands of research that use performance to address HCI and interaction design at the most fundamental level. We use these strands of research to map out what we have identified as the emerging field of Performative Experience Design. This field, which lies between HCI and performance studies, presents an extraordinarily rich potential for the design of interactive systems.</div>

<div class="textbox">We present MoodWings: a wearable butterfly that mirrors a userís real-time stress state through actuated wing motion. MoodWings was designed both as an early-stress-warning system as well as a physical interface for manipulating affective state. We hypothesized that MoodWings would help users calm down and perform better during stressful tasks; we tested these hypotheses on a common stressful task: driving. While users drove significantly more safely with MoodWings, they experienced higher stress levels (physiologically and self-perceived). Having MoodWings respond to positive affect instead did not mitigate this effect. Despite this, users were enthusiastic about using MoodWings in alternative contexts.</div>

By bringing together conceptual visions and initial experiments of alternative bio based approaches to sensing, display, fabrication, materiality, and energy, we seek to construct an inspirational discussion platform approaching non-living and living matter as a continuum for computational interaction. We also discuss the emergence of the DIY bio and open source biology movements, which allow non-biologists to gain access to the processes, tools, and infrastructure of this domain, and introduce Synbiota, an integrated, web-based platform for synthetic biology research</div>

<div class="textbox">The multitouch functionality of tabletop computers is often augmented by the use of tangible objects that offer an intuitive and haptic alternative to interaction and manipulation. However, employing tangibles can also lead to less desirable effects, such as occlusion or lack of precision. In this paper we highlight the design and implementation of ring-like tangible objects: TangibleRings. They do not occlude the objects underneath them and also support the detection of touch events inside their perimeter. Additionally, multiple rings may be nested within one another in order to combine ring functionality or produce more complex filters. </div>

<div class="textbox">In this paper, we present insights into a long-term project exploring Third Wave HCI [1] that focuses on muliple interpretation through many users. Building on the studioís design-led methodologies, over 60 research prototypes, called the Indoor Weather Stations [IWS], were batch-produced and deployed to more than 20 households over the course of a year to explore possibilities of polyphonic feedback from participants [2]. The devices were built to explore the microclimate of the home. We provide an account of three aspects integral to this batch-production of research prototypes; the recruitment of volunteers, the deployment to multiple households and finally the gathering of participant feedback. By adopting the format of a photo-essay to present practice based research, we offer a higher resolution of detail than can be articulated in a traditional written paper [3,4]. Images of design materials, research artefacts, events and participantís experience, alongside a spectrum of participant voices, enable us to provide insights into our methods of recruiting, deploying and gathering feedback in multiplicity.</div>

The system attempts to provide an initial experience of mindfulness meditation. To validate this subjective design goal, we conducted a qualitative investigation with 39 purposefully-selected participants. Systematic analysis using 3 independent data coders produced 11 specific findings which richly describe the Sonic Cradle experience. Several findings clearly compare to mindfulness meditation (e.g. clarity of mind, loss of intention). This paper introduces evidence suggesting that interactive ëtraining wheelsí could have a positive impact on long-term psychological health by experientially introducing established self-regulatory practices to non-practitioners.<br />

First of all, the performance of Eye Tracking (ET) + SSVEP is quite close to that of unimodal eye tracking. Furthermore despite lower performance of ET+ Motor Imagery due to the limitations of the hardware, the users appreciated the interaction modality and thought it was the most natural.</div>

<div class="textbox">This paper explores the metaphor of animism as a methodological framework for interaction design and, in particular, advocates for a form of animism the authors term ëheterogeneous multiplicity.í Animism can make valuable contributions within ubiquitous computing contexts, where objects with designed behaviors tend to evoke a perception that they have autonomy, intention, personality and an inner life. By deliberately supporting an embodied fiction through the metaphor of animism, designers can leverage the myth-making narrative capacities of people, and enable more fluid, productive, and meaningful relationship between humans and interactive systems. Furthermore, animism that supports heterogeneous multiplicity offers unique opportunities to stimulate human creativity through embodied engagement with an ecology of things. To demonstrate the concept of heterogeneous multiplicity, the authors present a speculative design project, AniThings that intertwines multiple animistic collaborators to position activities of digital resource discovery and curation beyond the narrow domain of recommendation engines and personal feeds. The project illustrates an ecology of six tangible, interactive objects that, respectively, draw from a range of digital resources and inhabit a range of variously positioned stances towards their human collaborators and each other. This diversity of behaviors, resources, and positionality makes AniThings ideal for supporting open-ended ideation and collaborative imagining activities.</div>

<div class="textbox">Gardening as an activity is devotional, built on the idea that through practice and effort, particular results can be obtained. Devotion is performative, taking time, skill, and repetition to get the results that you want. Human-scale farming depends on the labor of people to get things done, relying on hand tools and particular kinesthetic actions to change the earth in a plot. <br />
<br />
Digital media technologies afford the creation of tools that can materialize rhetoric, creating alternate functionality emphasizing issues of practice through use. Creating gardening implements that build on the repetitive physical nature of gardening work allows  handwork to become something broader: representative of, more reflexive and meditative technological practice.<br />

<div class="textbox">Pigmento is a design driven research aimed to foster children awareness by playing with colors. Shaped as rounded table, it allows to mix primary and derivates colors, anytime with any amount. The basic principle is to move a granular opaque material over the surface which is videoprojected from the bottom. Meanwhile the material is physically constant, the color is perceived according to the user interaction. Moreover there is no need of training, because of the hands-on approach. <br />
<br />
Further exploration has shown the potential to design any color synthesis. It works in the realm of Computer Vision technology, using laptop, projector and camera. The configuration includes OpenFrameworks, OpenCV and OpenGL.</div>

<div class="textbox">First impressions of visual appeal are an important factor that influence and predict overall desirability, perceived usability and consequent success of a product. Despite their importance, there is a surprising lack of research methods and real-world case studies on how practitioners can better understand the relationship between specific design elements of an interface and peopleís early perceptions of the interface. <br />
<br />
We propose a method that combines eye tracking analysis at the aggregate and individual level, first impressions testing, and qualitative feedback to compare peopleís first impressions of different designs. Our method provides visual and actionable feedback to a design team allowing them to design for specific affective goals.<br />

<div class="textbox">This paper explains how a productís usefulness is defined and measured. Many aspects of consumer product assessments relative to usefulness are conducted sub-consciously and this process is closely examined. A productís usefulness can be evaluated by measuring its advantages over alternative solutions based on specific criteria associated with fundamental needs. When multiple criteria are involved, different weights are assigned to each. We conclude that aspects of a productís usefulness, connected with sub-conscious human decision making processes, can be a major factor in predicting product acceptance and rejection rates.</div>

<div class="textbox">The proliferation of mobile computing devices, wireless and cellular Internet connections, and an always-on culture have led to an upsurge in usage of mobile devices in unexpected and possibly unusual settings for many different tasks. As technology becomes adopted, it is important to examine how it is used and peopleís reactions toward these unusual uses. This will help in understanding and describing the expected etiquette surrounding the technologyís usage. People now often use their mobile computing devices in both public and private restrooms. Through a survey of 204 respondents, we explored the acceptability of those practices and the types of tasks people complete using their mobile devices while in a restroom. We discovered 77% of respondents report using some type of mobile computing in restrooms, both public and private, for activities such as text messaging, web browsing, and email. We also determined that younger, male, and heavy technology users were more likely to use technology within restrooms. We discuss the various uses, social acceptance, and implications for technology design.</div>

The proposed framework follows an approach we call ëdigitally complemented zoomorphismí and recognizes ëplayí as a free and voluntary activity that is shared by both animals and humans. As a result, three initial design guidelines will emerge. Our work is pursued in order to provide animals with stimulations which stem from a closer understanding of their needs and preferences and are not solely designed around human subjectivity.</div>

<div class="textbox">This paper discusses the exploration of multimedia archives, and suggests ways of structuring navigation experiences conducive to the production of meaningful narratives. As archives begin to accumulate and catalogue extensive digital records methods of access and engagement are also adapting. Two categories of digital public space are explored; extensive curated public collections such as the BBC archive, and less obviously curated user-generated data such as Flickr photos and browsing data. The use of the term archival is here intended to refer to any group of materials organised in a structured way. The difference between traditional means of information structure and digital database ordering is also examined. Explorations of interface, narrative, and interaction frame the research, and an overview of relevant projects is provided. </div>

We contend that borg-human interaction (BHI) happens in a different context of traditional CHI characterized by the anthropomorphization of the interface, conflict with<br />
users, and dramatization of the interaction. This context requires the design of the human facet of the borg, a framework encompassing the borgís personality, social behavior, and embodied actions; and the strategies to co-create dramatic narratives with the user. We then propose six design methodologies to help designers construct the human facet of a borg.</div>

The main criterion for replacing established processes by technical solutions is usually improved efficiency regarding time or energy. In this paper, we present the design and evolution of a digital tracking system for consumption and payment of beverages ñ the Barkeeper. Its design was not primarily guided by efficiency, but practicality in day-to-day use. We, an HCI group of 20 people, have lived with our Barkeeper for 3 years now. In this trusted environment, we collected extensive usage (and beverage consumption) data, making this one of the larger field deployments of UbiComp technology. We present the Barkeeper, its usersí views on it, some insights gained by daily usage and identify important design rationales and future directions for the development of such systems.</div>

We present one approach to anonymization of research results with search engines in mind, which we call un-Googling, that we have developed to minimize risk to our participants. We discuss the considerations that this approach raises and pose a challenge to the HCI community to take up this discussion not only as an ethical consideration but also as a sociotechnical research and design opportunity.</div>

<div class="textbox">We propose a system for producing three-dimensional (3D) animations using miniature models. Our system enables users to interact with 3D objects (e.g., characters) and/or camera by direct manipulation of miniature models and enhances miniature modelsÅf power of expression using projection-mapping technology. The miniature models and virtual camera are tracked by an optical motion-tracking system, and their motions are reflected by 3D models in a virtual world. That is, users can control all 3D objects including camera in six dimension during the recording process. Using robots to reflect user-determined movements, the system also supports the production of repetitive step-by-step animation in which several objects move simultaneously. We developed a prototype on the basis of our approach and identified several flaws in the prototype.</div>

Nevertheless, we argue, some blind spots have remained: individual differences are frequently ignored, the prevalent measures of self-report rarely undergo verification, and overly focus is on hedonic dimensions of experience.<br />
A Stroop priming experiment was constructed to assess what people implicitly associate with a visual representation of a computing device. Three categories of target words were presented: hedonic, utilitarian and ìgeekî words. Longer response times were interpreted as stronger associations. Need-for-cognition and subject of undergraduate study (computer science vs. psychology) were taken as predictors for a hypothetical geek personality. The results suggest that persons with a geek predisposition tend to think of computers as objects of intellectual challenge and play, rather than tools or extensions of the self.<br />

<div class="textbox">We report the findings of a research study in which we interviewed 22 iPad owners in a large metropolitan area of the United States and use those findings to motivate some wide-reaching implications for everyday computing. We identify three themes characterizing iPad. The first is what it means to our participants to own an iPad: motivations for purchase, expectations and realities of patterns of use, shared use of the device in the home. The second theme explores the role of location: ëcomfortable computingí and the importance of connectivity. The third explores practices: content consumption and challenges with content creation, app discovery, and the desire for experiences that scale across device ecosystems. We then discuss three key areas for further design and research: comfortable computing, communal computing, the computer as media paradigm, and supporting creation that involves collection, curation, collage, annotation, and sharing.</div>

<div class="textbox">HCI has developed rich understandings of people at work and at play with technology: most people that is, except designers, who remain locked in the information processing paradigm of first wave HCI. Design methods are validated as if they were computer programs, expected to produce the same results on a range of architectures and hardware. Unfortunately, designers are people, and thus interfere substantially (generally to good effects) with the ëcodeí of design methods. We need to rethink the evaluation and design of design and evaluation methods in HCI. A logocentric proposal based on resource function vocabularies is presented.</div>

<div class="textbox">Balls are a kind of key equipment for sports and other entertainments such as juggling, etc. Therefore, with technological improvements in digital field, much research has been conducted for developing balls of the next generation to enhance ball related entertainments. Those balls have plenty of special functions that conventional balls do not have such as sound and light effects according to their motion. Unfortunately, such functions lack of variations currently. One of the reasons is the lack of input methods. As increasing the variations of balls with special functions, such as trajectory changeable balls, appropriate input method should be implemented to making use of plenty of special functions fully. In this research, we developed a force vector sensor sheet unit that can be implemented onto balls using PhotoelasticTouch technology. In this paper, we report this sensor‚Äôs performance evaluation and recognition principle.</div>

Currently, there are many previous researches for input method, mainly in English and Latin. But, the Chinese traditional phonetic input scheme is seldom discussed, particularly on touch screen. In order to reduce the input time, this study proposes an effective phonetic keyboard arrangement (EPKA) to reduce the average moving distance while typing. The proposed method  investigates the average moving distance by typing into phonetic symbols for words out of documents with respect to QWERTY (traditional phonetic keyboard arrangement) and EPKA respectively. Experimental results show that EPKA <br />
outperforms QWERTY by reducing  40-50% average moving distance. Moreover, the more characters input the shorter the average moving distance.</div>

<div class="textbox">Gesture-based interaction is widespread in touch screen interfaces. The goal of this paper is to tap the richness of expressive variation in gesture to facilitate continuous interaction. We achieve this through novel techniques of adaptation and estimation of gesture characteristics. We describe two experiments. The first aims at understanding whether users can control certain gestural characteristics and if that control depends on gesture vocabulary. The second study uses a machine learning technique based on particle filtering to simultaneously recognize and measure variation in a gesture. With this technology, we create a gestural interface for a playful photo processing application. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that 1) multiple characteristics can be varied independently in slower gestures, and 2) users find gesture-only interaction less pragmatic but more stimulating than traditional menu-based systems.</div>

<div class="textbox">In this paper, we propose a ball interface ÅgTAMAÅh (Trajectory chAnging, Motion bAll; ÅgtamaÅh means a ball in Japanese) that can change its own trajectory dynamically. Conventionally, it is impossible to go against the laws of physics. However, if the trajectory of balls can be changed during flight that virtually means balls can fly against physical laws. This should enhance the pleasure of ball-related games such as baseball, basketball, juggling, etc. In this research, we used the force of compressed gas from within the ball itself to change the ball trajectory. Previously, we developed the ball prototype equipped with a gas-jet unit. However, the primal prototype was too heavy to use in amusement. Additionally, there was no control of the timing of the jet. In this paper, we introduce the latest prototype of TAMA, which trims the weight and adds new functionality. We discuss the feasibility of this system through experimentation in changing the ballÅfs trajectory during downward flight.</div>

The current understanding of how to design these objects and interaction opportunities to create meaningful interactions and engaging user experiences is limited. In this paper a framework is introduced that focuses on decentralized interactive play environments. This framework is a challenge to create because it combines knowledge from different fields including play, user experience, emergent behavior and interactions.

The interaction devices have been selected to augment and improve the expert work in a specific medical application context which shows its potential. In the sensitive domain of examining patients in a cancer screening program we try to combine several active user input devices in the most convenient way for both the patient and the doctor. The resulting multimodal AR application has the potential to yield higher performance outcomes and provides a direct data acquisition control mechanism. It effectively leverages the doctorís capabilities of recalling the specific patient context by a virtual, context-based patient-specific îexternal brainî for the doctor which can remember patient faces and adapts the virtual augmentation according to the specific patient observation and finding context.

<div class="textbox">Personal informatics systems that help people both collect and reflect on various kinds of personal information are growing rapidly. Despite the importance of journaling and the main role it has in tracking one&#039;s personal growth, a limited number of studies have examined this topic in the area of personal informatics in detail. In this paper, we critically examine the process of reflection on experiences, thoughts and evolving insights through a qualitative research study. We also present the design research process we conducted to develop the Wandering Mind as a support tool to help individuals record and reflect on their experiences.</div>

<div class="textbox">Persuasive games, though successful in behavioral change, tend to have limited focus, due to their domain specific characteristics. Many have looked for ways to make persuasive games fun by using visually engaging elements, or challenging tasks. Some rely on charming characters moving through virtual worlds, and others give priority to narrative, making characters policy followers. Yet, to our knowledge, a method to design the visual, narrative and interactive components, that considers them as equal means to persuade, has not been created. We present a method, envisioned after workshops, inspired by precepts of participatory design, in an aim to develop a guideline of use. We display our improvements, show results, discuss findings, and talk about limitations in our scope and future work.</div>

<div class="textbox">Since the personal computing revolution first brought computers into the home, there have been a plethora of tools to help writers produce narratives.  Spell-checking, word counts, readability analysis, and version control give today\&#039;s novelists tools that Dickens, Austen, and Shakespeare could only have dreamt of.  However,  such tools have focused on the word (spell-checking), or phrase  (grammar checking, Flesch-Kincaid readability tests) levels. In the last decade, research focus has shifted to more support for collaborative editing of documents, but any tool that seeks to visualise, let alone modify, the themes or structure of a creative work is viewed with deep suspicion by the writing community.   This work considers more sophisticated attempts to visualise pace and rhythm within a narrative and analyses the application of two visualisation tools in several domains.  The key insight of this project is that these visualisations, although created by an absolutely objective process, can be interpreted subjectively in the same way that the original text can be.</div>

The task is to produce testable prototypes, the first of which we call NEVO (Non-Embarrassing Version One) that faithfully embodies the concept. We probed leading HCI researchers and CHI authors about the challenge of Finding NEVO. We found uncertainty on how to design prototypes that allow for both design and scientific contributions. We propose the Finding-NEVO model that articulates a process yielding prototypes that are faithful to the rationale and idea being studied. We conclude by discussing our theoretical and methodological contributions.</div>

To operate a BCI, users learn to produce stable brain activity patterns which are recognized using signal processing. Although promising, BCI remain barely used outside laboratories, due to their low reliability. So far, BCI research was mostly focused on signal processing, thus neglecting human training. Based on educational research literature, we argue that current BCI training approachesare highly inappropriate. We point out the flaws in training protocols and propose new directions theoretically expected to efficiently train users to control BCI, hence improving their reliability.</div>

We integrate a blimp with an AR marker to overcome two problems found in conventional AR applications. One problem is mobility. While a conventional AR marker is generally paper-based and static, ‚ÄúAero-Marker‚Äù floats in the air and moves toward the user. Thus, the relationship between the user and marker changes. The other problem is physicality. Unlike a paper-based marker, Aero-Marker has physical volume because it uses a physical blimp. Virtual information is overlaid on the entire surface of the blimp, like texture mapping in 3D computer graphics, making the virtual information tangible. Thus, the interaction between the user and marker changes.</div>

We present three unique installation designs, software implementation techniques and a discussion of the user experiences in each of the installations. Our contribution is intended to help creative designers and interactive artists by presenting the theoretical foundation behind chronographing, providing illustrations of different design processes that utilize the approach, and outlining practical details of the software methods we developed to support our approach.

Specifically, this research investigates when consumers do move from a cognitive script formation phase to a script activation phase while using a retail website. Six subjects performed ten visits to a website and electroencephalography (EEG) measurements were taken simultaneously. Based on this data, a cognitive workload index was calculated and compared across visits. Results suggest that there was a significant change in subjectsí cognitive workload between the first two visits and the remaining visits, suggesting that cognitive scripts were formed during the first two visits and then activated during the remaining visits.

<div class="textbox">User experience (UX) is defined as the way a person feels when using a product. This term is commonly used referring to interactive computer-based systems. Anyway a good user experience when interacting with everyday products, not necessarily computer-based, is becoming a key factor for their success on the market. Indeed, it is one of the major drivers to the perceived quality about a product. Consequently, marketing experts who strongly influence company strategic decisions, are urging design teams on prioritizing the design of the user experience respect to technical and functional features. Besides user experience is subjective in nature since it involves personal multisensory feelings during product interaction and use. Hence, the necessity to properly consider UX issues when designing common products, is also demanding a change in currently applied design methods and tools. Virtual Prototyping based on multisensory Virtual Reality environments seems to be appropriate for this purpose. A justification to that statement is provided in this paper, where we describe a methodology developed for the design of user experience with everyday products through the use of interactive virtual prototypes.</div>

<div class="textbox">When selecting targets in a Smart TV service, the user is frequently required to select remote targets such as menu items, but is unable to touch the targets directly or use a mouse. Solutions include gesture-based rapid selection techniques. However, such techniques have problems in that they hide the original information. We propose Trace Select, a novel technique for selecting remote targets; it generates gesture guides from the targetsÅf characters. The guides donÅft conceal the original targets. An experiment shows that Trace Select outperforms cursor-based pointing and activation- required gestural selection.</div>

<div class="textbox">We propose here an objective study of the emotional impact of a movie on an audience. An affective benchmarking solution is introduced making use of a low-intrusive measurement of the well-known ElectroDermal Answer. A dedicated processing of this biosignal produces a time-variant and normalized affective signal related to the significant excitation variations of the audience. Besides the new methodology, the originality of this paper stems from the fact that this framework has been tested on a real audience during regular cinema shows and a film festival, for five different movies and a total of 128 audience members.</div>

<div class="textbox">In this research, we proposed a new display with a dynamically changeable softness parameter called ClaytricSurface.<br />
While conventional displays generally have fixed softness, we focused on interactive displays with a controllable softness property.<br />
We developed a prototype system by using polystyrene particle material and dynamic negative pressure control techniques to dynamically change display softness.<br />
We also developed a prototype application for entertainment use and further explored the interaction possibilities with this type of surface. </div>

<div class="textbox">This study offers a series of recommendations for distance education institutions and for its Virtual Campus to facilitate the learning process for visually impaired students. It is based on a case study conducted at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (Open University of Catalonia, UOC), a distance learning university in Spain, in which 15 visually impaired students were interviewed in depth in their natural context for studying (their homes) to learn more about their daily activities as students, as well as the main difficulties they encounter in the distance learning process. Additionally, a usability test was conducted on the UOCís Virtual Campus</div>
